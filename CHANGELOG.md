- **USB priority now has a way back.** If an accessory is attached but no AOA link comes up
  within 10 s (a charge-only cable, or a phone that will not switch to accessory mode), the
  Bluetooth advertisement is restored automatically. Without the fallback the app would sit
  on "waiting for phone" with no pairing code and no way forward.
