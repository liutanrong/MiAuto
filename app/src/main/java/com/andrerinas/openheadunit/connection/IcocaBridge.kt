/**
 * Bridges the MiAuto ICCOA CarLink SDK (a plain Java facade, [IccoaManager]) into DiAuto's
 * reactive architecture.
 *
 * DiAuto drives every consumer from a single `StateFlow` (see `CommManager.connectionState`);
 * the ICCOA SDK instead pushes callbacks on worker threads. This class is the adapter between
 * the two: it implements [IccoaManager.Listener], folds the raw callbacks into one observable
 * [state], and exposes the navigation stream the BYD cluster / HUD outputs consume.
 *
 * MiAuto is ICCOA-only — there is no Android Auto path at runtime — so this bridge (not
 * `CommManager`) is the source of truth for both the home screen and the projection activity.
